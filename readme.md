## Mediolano

Mediolano empowers creators, artists and organizations to make money from their content, without requiring them to know anything about crypto.

With permissionless services for Programmable Intellectual Property (IP), leveraging Starknet’s high-speed, low-cost transactions and zero-knowledge proofs, Mediolano provides a comprehensive suite of solutions to tokenize and monetize assets efficiently, transparently and with sovereignty.

With zero fees, Mediolano’s open-source protocol and dapp ensures immediate tokenization and protection under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886), covering 181 countries. This framework guarantees global recognition of authorship, providing verifiable proof of ownership for 50 to 70 years, depending on jurisdiction.

The platform also introduces advanced monetization, enabling diverse approaches to licensing, royalties, and financing creators economies. These tools are designed to offer integrations with various ecosystems, including communities, games, and AI agents, unlocking the true power of Programmable IP for the Integrity Web.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

* **Node.js** (version 18 or later) and npm installed. Download them from the official Node [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* **Basic understanding** of Starknet Foundry to deploy your own contract instance
* **Cairo** and **Scarb** for smart contract development

### System Requirements

- **Npm + Git**
- **ASDF + Scarb**
- **Starknet CLI**
- **Starknet Foundry**
- **Operating System**: macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediolano-app/mediolano-contracts.git
cd mediolano-contracts
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
# Install Scarb (Cairo package manager)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh

# Install Starknet Foundry
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

3. **Build contracts**:

```bash
# Build all contracts
scarb build

# Or build specific contract
cd contracts/IP-Club
scarb build
```

4. **Run tests**:

```bash
# Run all tests
scarb test

# Run tests for specific contract
cd contracts/User-Achievements
scarb test
```

└── docs/                          # Documentation
```

### Building and Testing

Each contract directory contains its own `Scarb.toml` configuration file. You can build and test contracts individually:

```bash
# Navigate to specific contract
cd contracts/IP-Club

# Build the contract
scarb build

# Run contract tests
scarb test

# Format code
scarb fmt
```

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to Starknet networks:

```bash
# Deploy to Sepolia testnet
starkli deploy ./target/dev/contract_name.contract_class.json \
  --network sepolia \
  --keystore ./keystore.json

# Deploy to mainnet
starkli deploy ./target/dev/contract_name.contract_class.json \
  --network mainnet \
  --keystore ./keystore.json
```

## 🛡️ Security

### Security Measures

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin components
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations throughout
- **Pause Functionality**: Emergency pause capabilities for critical contracts
